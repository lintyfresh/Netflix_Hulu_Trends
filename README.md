# About Me

My name is Lynn Tong. I'm currently enrolled in the University of San Francisco's Master in Data Science program.

# Project Description

This respository analyzed trends regarding content on Netflix and Hulu for studio and content creation use cases. Tools like Pandas and Matplotlib were used to clean and join data in addition to creating tables and charts.

# Findings

1. Confirmed that the median movie duration by release year has been going down.
2. Median move duration by year uploaded, however, was steadily increasing on both platforms. Studios should prioritize quality storytelling over shorter move times.
